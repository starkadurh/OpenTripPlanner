 * {@link org.opentripplanner.graph_builder.services.GraphBuilderModule} plugin that links various objects
 * in the graph to the street network. It should be run after both the transit network and street network are loaded.
 * It links three things: transit stops, bike rental stations, and park-and-ride lots. Therefore it should be run
 * even when there's no GTFS data present to make bike rental services and parking lots usable.
